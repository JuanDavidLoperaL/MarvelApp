# MarvelApp
App created with MVVM-C as architecture
Unit test implemented
Home and detail screen implemented

# Modules
Design System Module created, the reason is because I want to reuse the code and also because in that way with just a line of code I can setup a label, view or button very quickly

APIManager module created, the reason, is because I need to create 2 request, I dont want to split the request logic for all the app and alson I dont want to duplicate the code, so APIManager was a really good idea
